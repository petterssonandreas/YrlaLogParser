# YrlaLogParser
Parser for the driving log of Yrla, the car belonging to Y-sektionen. Can be used by the treasurer for billing.

Requires Python 3. To run, simply download the project and run (double-click) the file run.bat. The first time chrome (or another web browser) might request you to authenticate yourself to Google. You might also need to have the spreadsheet "Yrla Liggare (Svar)" actually shared with the account being used (not tested without).
